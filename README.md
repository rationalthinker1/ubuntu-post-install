# Ubuntu Post Install Script
Tired of having to install all the applications you need everytime you install a fresh Ubuntu on your computer? 
Look no more. Meant to be an easy way to install applications silently without user intervention.

- Look over at install.sh to see what is being installed by default and comment out the line in which the application that you don't want appears.
- ./install.sh
